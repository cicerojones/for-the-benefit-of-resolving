** start with a local project to track remotely
1. create a directory
2. create a file
3. initialize the directory as a git repo
4. stage the file
5. commit the changes
6. check your git status
7. create a new repository remotely (use Github's interface)
8. add a remote to your git project
   1. git remote add origin <URL>
9. push the existing repo up from the command line to the remote server (see below)
   1. git push -u origin master
   2. what could go wrong!
10. begin branching (see next)

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
git remote add origin git@github.com:cicerojones/for-the-benefit-of-resolving.git
#+END_SRC
** work with branches and multiple computers
1. you can "create branch" on bitbucket, but not github?
2. create a local branch
