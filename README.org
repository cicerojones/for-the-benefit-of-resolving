* This is the first file
** start with a local project to track remotely
1. create a directory
2. create a file
3. initialize the directory as a git repo
4. stage the file
5. commit the changes
6. check your git status
7. create a new repository remotely (use Github's interface)
8. add a remote to your git project
   1. git remote add origin <URL>
9. push the existing repo up from the command line to the remote server (see below)
   1. git push -u origin master
   2. what could go wrong!
10. begin branching (see next)

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
git remote add origin git@github.com:cicerojones/for-the-benefit-of-resolving.git
#+END_SRC

What's this mean (as reported by magit when pushing up "unmerged" commits)?
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
git push -v origin master:refs/heads/master
#+END_SRC
** work with branches and multiple computers
1. you can "create branch" on bitbucket, but not github?
2. create and checkout a local branch
   1. you will be given options where to "start" the branch
      1. HEAD
      2. master [this the magit default]
      3. origin/master
   2. you must give the branch a name
** clone the repo onto a different computer
1. on github you can click "clone" to get the URL
2. switch to the directory you want to be your "container"
3. magit-clone (is different from =git clone= or not?) using the copied URL
   1. many strange or bewildering things can happen here, mostly involving ssh configuration
** get ready to create conflicting changes
1. confirm what branch you are on
